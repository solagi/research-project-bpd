# Project abstract

This research examines how Bipolar Disorder (BPD) can be assessed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression. Used dataset consists of visual feature data extracted from BPD subjects, and label dataset of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) to assess the BPD state. Various experiments are performed under this research with the main objective of finding the most accurate model setup for the BPD state assessment. Experimental setup differ in terms of data composition, applied functionals and included subsets of facial features for the model training.
